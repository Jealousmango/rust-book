# Functions
## Chapter 3.3

> In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.
> Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.
> Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the let keyword is a statement.
> Expressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of the code that you’ll write in Rust.
